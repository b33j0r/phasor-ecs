# `phasor-ecs`

An entity component system implementation. It is built on top of
`phasor-db` (entity-component database) and `phasor-graph` (graph
library for dependency resolution).

`phasor-ecs` is not a game engine. It provides the ECS framework
which combines a database with schedules and systems. For a game
engine, see `phasor` (not yet released).
